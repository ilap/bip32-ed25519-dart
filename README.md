The Dart implementation of the BIP32-Ed25519 the deterministic key generation scheme for Edward25519 curve
# API Interfaces

TBD

# Key Types
- ED25519 (RFC 8032) Keys 
    - the generated ed25519 signing key is 64-byte long and is created by the concatenation of the ED25519 seed (private key) and the generated public key.
    - the private key a.k.a seed is a 32-byte long cryptographically secure random data.
- ED25519 Extended Keys
    - the private key is a 64-byte long cryptographically secure random data, and it can be interpreted as the SHA512 hashed and clear/set bit of an ED25519 seed or the first 32-byte (the seed part) of the ED25519 secret/private key. 
    - they also can be interpreted as standalone keys, though brute-force is required for retrieving the ED25519 seed from an extended key.
    - The clears are set based on the RFC8032 specification.
    - an Extended key's left 32-byte is equivalent /w a `X25519` (for `EcDH`) private key.
- BIP32-ED25519 Keys
    - BIP32-ED25519 derivation requires that the 3rd bit of the 31th bytes of an ED25519 Extended key must be cleared.
    - This means that every `BIP32-ED2559` signing key is valid `Extended ED25519 key`,
    - but half of the ED25519 Extended and therefore half of the ED25519 keys are not compatible /w BIP32-ED25519 keys.

### ED25519 Keys

The [ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) is an 
[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algortithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) using curve25519 by [Dan Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html), 
[Niels Duif](http://www.nielsduif.nl/), 
[Tanja Lange](http://hyperelliptic.org/tanja), 
[Peter Schwabe](http://www.cryptojedi.org/users/peter/), 
and [Bo-Yin Yang](http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/byyang/).

The key is 64-byte long and contains the the 32-byte long seed a.k.a private key that is used for 
generate the secret key and public key.

### ED25519 Extended keys

The 64-byte long extended keys contains either 
    - only the 64-byte long secret key.
    - or the 64-byte long extended private key and the 32-byte public key similar to the normal 
    ED25519 key whihc contains the 32-byte private key (seed) and the 32-byte long private key.

Though, `pinenacl-dart`'s extended interface expecting a concatenated secret and public key.
It's due to the assumption that the public key is already known (no scalar_base multiplication is needed for retrieveing the key)

The [message signing and signature verifying is compatible /w ED25519](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubyCrypto/ed25519/master/ed25519.png).


### BIP32-ED25519 Keys

The 96-byte long BIP32-ED25519 keys contains a ed25519e_sk and the chain code.
The message signing and signature verifying is compatible /w ED25519.

# Restrictions

In Cardano blockchain, the keys are derived by the `BIP32-ED25519` specification.

The `BIP32-ED25519`, in addition to the `ED25519` [(RFC 8032)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032), needs the 3rd bit cleared of the 31th byte.

Therefore, the half of the `ED25519 Extended` secret keys and therefore the half of the  `ED25519` private keys are not compatible /w `BIP32-ED25519`.

To overcome of this restriction, different wallet implementation decided to generate their master node/root key differently (as BIP32-ED25519 specification only requires that bit cleared on the master node/root key as the derived keys would have that bit cleared in the derivation functions anyway). 

Some of them (such as Yoroi), just clear that `additional` 3rd bit, while others (such as the old Daedalus) are hashing the corresponding master key until they find a compatible key, and when it's found, they set and clear the bits as specified in the `RFC 8032`.

 ## Resolution

There can be different type of resolutions. The most proper way would be: generate only a `BIP32-ED25519` compatible 24-word mnemonics and therefore a 256-bit long master secret for new wallets and discard others (as it's is specified in the `Bip32-Ed25519` paper).
Then use that 256-bit master secret as `k` specified in `BIP32-ED25519`.

Drawback of this is that half of the already existing user's mnemonics are not compatible, therefore
they need either to move to a new wallet or using some out-dated master-key generation algorithm. The other disadvantege of this is that it would impact the `plausible-deniability` feature, meaning by when a `BIP32-ED25519` compatible 256-bit long seed is generated from a 24-word mnemonic with using an additional password/passphrase by `BIP-0039`, it could happen that the other seed generated from the same mnemonic, but with no or some different passhprase, would not be `BIP-ED25519` compatible.
